# Product Philosophy

This document outlines the core principles that guide TMC Studio's product development, monetization strategy, and user experience design.

## Core Principle: Product-Led Growth (PLG)

TMC Studio is built on **Product-Led Growth** principles. The product itself drives user acquisition, conversion, and expansion—not aggressive sales tactics or dark patterns.

### What This Means in Practice

1. **Value First, Payment Later**
   - Users discover value before hitting paywalls
   - Free usage is generous and genuinely useful
   - Upgrade happens naturally when users hit real limits

2. **Friction-Free Onboarding**
   - No login required to start using the app
   - Guest mode provides immediate value
   - Account creation unlocks more, but isn't mandatory

3. **Transparent Limitations**
   - When users hit a limit, we explain WHY
   - We show WHAT they get by upgrading
   - No surprise paywalls or hidden restrictions

## The Three-Tier Strategy

### Guest Mode
**Philosophy:** "Try before you trust us"

- **No account required** to start using TMC Studio
- Users can create tactics immediately
- Limited but functional (1 project, 5 steps, PNG export)
- This is the first impression—make it count

**Why this matters:**
- Reduces friction to near-zero
- Builds trust through immediate value delivery
- Users see the quality before committing

### Free Plan
**Philosophy:** "Free is free, not a trial"

- Unlocked by creating an account
- 3 projects, 10 steps per project, cloud sync
- Not a time-limited trial—it's genuinely free forever
- Should serve hobbyists and casual users indefinitely

**Why this matters:**
- Shows respect for users who can't/won't pay
- Creates a large user base for word-of-mouth
- Free users provide feedback and community value

### Pro Plan
**Philosophy:** "Upgrade when you need it, not before"

- Unlimited projects and steps
- Advanced export formats (GIF, PDF)
- For serious coaches and content creators
- Priced for value received, not artificial scarcity

**Why this matters:**
- Users upgrade because they NEED features, not because we force them
- Creates happy customers who see clear value
- Sustainable business model aligned with customer success

## UX Design Principles

### 1. No Dark Patterns

**What we DON'T do:**
- ❌ Show pricing modals on app load
- ❌ Hide the free plan or make it hard to find
- ❌ Use fake urgency ("Only 2 spots left!")
- ❌ Make cancellation difficult
- ❌ Trick users into paying

**What we DO:**
- ✅ Always explain WHY a modal appears
- ✅ Make free and paid features clearly distinct
- ✅ Provide context before showing limits
- ✅ Allow easy upgrades AND downgrades
- ✅ Respect the user's intelligence

### 2. Contextual, Not Interruptive

Upgrade prompts appear when:
- ✅ User hits a real limit (runs out of projects/steps)
- ✅ User tries to use a Pro feature (GIF export)
- ✅ User explicitly asks for pricing info

Upgrade prompts DO NOT appear when:
- ❌ User opens the app
- ❌ User is in the middle of creative work
- ❌ Randomly as interruptions
- ❌ As popups during animations

### 3. Value Explanation Over Sales Pressure

When showing upgrade prompts, we:
- Explain WHAT the user tried to do
- Show WHAT they currently have vs. what they need
- Present WHAT they'll get by upgrading
- Provide clear path forward (free account OR upgrade)

We avoid:
- Aggressive CTAs ("BUY NOW!")
- Artificial urgency
- Feature-shaming ("You're missing out!")
- Guilt trips

### 4. Guest → Free → Pro Is A Journey, Not A Funnel

This is not a "conversion funnel" where we trick guests into paying.

This is a **user journey** where:
1. Guest discovers value (try the core product)
2. Free user commits (saves work, uses regularly)
3. Pro user scales (needs advanced features)

Each step should feel natural. Forcing the journey creates bad experiences.

## Messaging Guidelines

### When Users Hit a Limit

**Bad:** "Upgrade to Pro to continue"

**Good:** "You've added 5 steps—that's the Guest limit. Create a free account to get 10 steps per project and save your work."

**Why:** Explains what happened, what the limit is, and provides context for next step.

### When Promoting Free Account

**Bad:** "Sign up now!"

**Good:** "Continue for free"

**Why:** Emphasizes no cost, no pressure. This is about unlocking features, not extracting payment.

### When Promoting Pro Plan

**Bad:** "Unlock all features now!"

**Good:** "Upgrade to Pro for unlimited projects and GIF export"

**Why:** Specific value proposition. Users know exactly what they're getting.

## Key Copy Phrases

These phrases embody our product philosophy:

- **"Continue for free"** - Not "Sign up" (eliminates payment fear)
- **"Create free account"** - Not "Start trial" (it's genuinely free)
- **"Compare plans"** - Not "See pricing" (focus on value, not price)
- **"Upgrade when you need it"** - Not "Upgrade now" (no pressure)
- **"Free stays free forever"** - Not "No credit card required" (more positive framing)

## What Success Looks Like

### For Guest Users
- They create at least one complete tactic
- They understand the core value proposition
- They know what Free unlocks (without being pestered)

### For Free Users
- They use TMC Studio regularly
- They save and manage multiple projects
- They feel respected, not nickled-and-dimed
- Some convert to Pro when they hit real limits

### For Pro Users
- They upgraded because they WANTED the features
- They feel the price is fair for value received
- They recommend TMC Studio because the experience is great
- They stay subscribed because it solves their problem

## Anti-Goals

Things we explicitly choose NOT to optimize for:

- ❌ **Conversion rate at all costs** - We won't trick users into paying
- ❌ **Maximize pricing tiers** - We won't create artificial scarcity
- ❌ **Lock-in through data hostage** - Users can export and leave
- ❌ **Growth hacking gimmicks** - No fake counters, false urgency, etc.
- ❌ **Aggressive upselling** - We show value, users decide

## Long-Term Vision

We're building a product that:
- Users **recommend** to friends because the experience is genuinely good
- Coaches **trust** because we respect their creative process
- The market **respects** because we don't use manipulative tactics

Sustainable growth through great product experience > short-term revenue through dark patterns.

This is the foundation. Everything else builds on this.

**Remember:** When in doubt, ask: "Would this annoy me as a user?" If yes, don't do it.
